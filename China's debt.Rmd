# Consumer loans

# <center>Local government financing vehicles</center>
<center>The “Augmented” Fiscal Deficit</center>
<center>of Local Governments</center>

---

# Why?

* 1994 fiscal reform
* Local governments have to spend much more than they collect

![](Billede3.png)

* Transfers from Beijing necessary
* Official borrowing requires prior approval from Beijing 

---

# How?

![](Billede4.png)
---

# Problems

* Transparency: ‘Augmented’ fiscal deficit (IMF, 2019)
  * official public debt (approx. 40% of GDP)
	* off-books public debt (approx. 30% of GDP)
* Higher interest rates
* Unsustainable business model
  * Short-term loans for long-term projects 
  * Not enough liquidity to service debt, so based on land “sales”
* Central government loses control
* Financial risk? 
  * Moody’s (2019): 39% of total outstanding corporate bonds

# Central government responses

* 2014
  * Ban on new LGFV debt
  * New regulated PPPs
  * Quota for official borrowing instead of prior approval
  * Swapping program to bonds 

  But alternative off-the-books borrowing still went up!
* 2018-2019
  * Allow LGFV defaults   ➡️   Interest rates    ⬆️    Borrowing   ⬇️
  * Swapping program to cheap long-term loans by the China Development Bank

---

# Central government responses

* 2020
  * Increased quota
  * Increased central government transfers to service local debt
* 2021
  * Decreased quota

# <center>Corporate debt</center>

# Market-based vs Bank-based Financial System

![](Kopi af Chinese Corporate debt - Friso .svg)

---

# China has a bank-based system and this increases systemic risk

* Systemic risk may be defined as a disruption to the flow of financial services that is (i) caused by an impairment of all or parts of the financial system; and (ii) has the potential to have serious negative consequences for the real economy (BIS, FSB and IMF, 2009).

* A paper written by Houben & Bats (2017) writes about the increased risks in a bank-based system like China. 

  * Leverage
  * Asset-liability mismatch (short-term liabilities vs long-term assets)
  * Intermediation chains


---

# Global Recession 

* Concerns for growth (exports) 

* Two Choices:
  * FX depreciation
  * Keynesian stimulus 

* Extra capital for banks

# Non-financial debt-to-GDP ratio

---

# China’s corporate debt

* Chinese Corporate debt is one of the highest in the world

* After 2009 stimulus, it went from 93% of GDP to 116% and now to more than 150%.

* ⅓ of the debt is local government debt and ⅔ is from SOEs to state-owned banks

---


![](Billede1.png)
---

# What are the problems

* NPLs and the balance sheets

* Possibility of shocks

* High debt-servicing ratio

* The rise of wealth management products (WMPs)

---

# Net Debt / EBITDA of 1189 mid-to large-cap companies

![](Billede2.png)

---
# Systemic risk? Not in the short-run. 

* China is still in a high growth period 

* High savings rate

* Most loans are made to SOEs by state-owned banks 

* Attempts to improve NPLs but costly (social costs)

---
# But future challenges!

* De-leveraging vs GDP 

* COVID-19

* Trade War 

* What happens with a big shock or low growth and higher interest rates? 

---

# Conclusion

* Safe mortgages, unsafe consumption

* LGFVs on retreat due to reform

* Corporate debt rising fast
  * Not a short term risk
  * But future challenges!
